# Sample Code

This package provides some samples for:
  1) Publishing and subscribing ROS topics from C++ classes
  2) Using a service server and client from C++ classes
  3) Using ROS to run a shell script


## Examples
After building, running the `example_pub_sub.launch` example will mimic the ROS Publisher/Subscriber and Server/Client examples, but structured as C++ classes
```bash
roslaunch proprietary_template example_pub_sub.launch
```

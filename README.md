# proprietary_template
This provides a template for new NRG repos. It includes files that NRG ROS repos generally all need.

Things you'll need to fill in:
 - Package name in the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml
 - Copyright year in License.txt
 - The CHANGELOG.md
 - This README!
 - Create or delete branches as needed
